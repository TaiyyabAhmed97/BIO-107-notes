I.Food and Energy production
	-organism can be classifies as:
		-autotrophs: covert inorganic chemicals to organic chemicals(food)
			-producers
		-hererotrophs: convert organic food chemicals to other organic 			chemicals
			-consumers
II.Autotrophs
	-produce food in 2 ways
		1.photoautotrophs - energy transfer from sunlight
		2.chemoautotrophs - enregy from chemicals
III.Photoautotrophs
	-green plants, protists, etc.
	-use photosynthesis to capture energy from sunlight and produce:
		-food we eat
		-oxygen we breathe
IV.Photosynthesis
	-process by which light energy converted to chemical energy
V.2 steps in Photosynthesis
	-light reactions
		-use sunlight, H2O
		-makes O2 ATP NADPH
	-dark reactions
		-use CO2 ATP NADPH
		-makes sugars
VI.Reactions in Photosynthesis
	-Light Dependent
	-Light Independent
VII.2 steps above are linked by ATP and NADPH
	-light reactions convert light energy and produce O2
	-calvin cycle
VIII. where is photosynthesis
	-occurrs in chloroplasts
	-contains
		-stroma - fluid inside the inner membrane
		-grana, (stacks of thylakoids)
	-each thylakoid contains chloprophyll
	-chlorophyll is green pigment that captures light energy
IX.Chlorophyll absorb light
	-these pigments absorb light energy and transfer enregy to electrons
	-absorb red and blue light
	-reflect green and yellow light
	-when a photon of correct wavelength strikes cholorphyll, its energy is 	absorbed
	-chlorphyll molecules work in groups
		-form a photosystem
			-contains antenna and reaction center
		-form a complex
X.Photosystem 2 is in thylakoid membranes
	-when photons strike antenna comple, energy is abosrbed by electron in 		chlopphyll molecule
	-energized electron is passed to nearby chlorophyll molecules
	-hops all the way to reaction center
XI.The reaction cneter
	-excited electron is passed to an electron acceptor (molecule)
	-the molecule accepts the high energy electron and donates it into the 		electron transport chain
XII. ATP in light reactions
	-electron transport chains are arranged with the photosystems  in thylakoid 		membrane and pump H+ through
	-flow of H+ allows production of ATP by ATP synthase and gradient of H+ ions
	-stroma takes H+ and makes NADPH
XIII. 2 reaction centers
	-photosystem 2 and 1
XIV.Photosystem 1
	-in algae and land plants, reduces NADP to NADPH which carries stored 		energy as electrons and protons
	-NADPH is then used in Calvin Cycle
	-excited electrons from reaction center of photosystem 1 are passed down electron transport chain to ferradoxin
	-an enzyme transfers a proton and 2 electrons from ferradoxin to NADPH
XV.Key events in light reactions
	-2 connected photosystems collect photons and transfer energy yo 		cholorphyll electrons
	-excited electron are sent to electron transport chains
	-ATP, NADPH, O2 are produced
XVI.Electron dynamic in phtosyntheisis
	-where elctrons come form
		-in photosystem 2 , electrons come form splitting water
		-in photosystem 1 , electronc ome from phtosystem 2
XVII.Calvin Cycle, light independent reactions
	-input: CO2, ATP, NADPH
	-output: G3P
	-occurs in stroma of choloroplast
	-where carbon fixation takes place and sugar is manufactured
	-powered by ATP and NADPH
XVIII.what calvin cycle does
	-contructs G3P( a carbon molecule) using
		-carbon from atmospheric CO2
		-electrons and H+ from NADPH
		-energy from ATP
	-energy rich 3 carbon molecule is converted to glucose
	(1)Carbon Fixation: CO2 racts with RuBP, producing 2 3-phosphoglycerate 	moleucles
	(2)Reduction of 3 phosphoglycerate to G3P
	(3)Regeneration of RuBP from G3P
IXX.Photosynthesis and Atmosphere
	-most oxygen in atmosphere is produced by photosynthesis
	-photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from atmosphere and
XX.Carbon dioxide cycle
