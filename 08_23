I. Backgournd History
	-Lavoisier experimented with creating water and reversing to decompose 		water into hydrogen and water
	-conlcuded that water was not an element, as had been aways previously 		thought.
II. Elements and Atoms
	-Element: cannot be broken down in a chemical reaction
	-Atom: smallest unit of matter
	-Molecule: 2 or more atoms joined by covalent bonds
	-Compound: contains 2 or more elements in a fixed ratio.
III. Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons
	*Atomic structure
		-protons, neutrons in a nucleus, electrons orbiting around.
	-Each atom is held together by attractions of the protons and electrons.
IV. Electrons
	*Arranged in shells representing energy levels
	-First electron shell can hold 2 
	-Second shell can hold 8 
V. Molecule
	*2 or more atoms joined by chemical bonds
	*make chemical bonds is putting energy into it
	*break chemical bonds it releasing energy
VI. Chemical bonds
	-Covalent: sharing electrons
		-NonPolar bond: electrons are shared equally between 2 atoms
		-Polar bond: unequal sharing of electrons. partial charges exist
	-Ionic: gain or loss of electrons
		-atoms that loses an elctron becomes a positively charged cation
		-atoms that gains an electron becomes a negatively charged anion.
	-Hydrogen: weak linkages in polar molecules
		-can form between or within molecules
		-weak interaction
		-consequence of polar covalent bonds
VII. Water's structure and its properties
	-Solvnet: dissolves more compounds than any other liquid, but will not 		dissolve non polat covalent molecules
	-Density: Ice less dense than liquid water
	-Cohesion: gives it surface tension.
	-Solute: what dissolves into a solvent
	-Solution: solvent + solution
	* Water is not a universal solution
		-Hydrophilic compounds interact with water ( NaCl )
		-Hydrophobic compounds do not interact with water ( oil )
	* Water's Hydrogen bonds moderate temp
		-water is able to absorb a great deal of heat energy without a 			large increase in temp.
		-hydrogen bonds make water cohesive
VIII. Acid and Base
	- A compound that releases Hydrogen ions in in solution is an acid
	- A compound that accepts from a solution is a base
	-pH scale: 0-7 is acidic, 8-14 is basic
	-Acids donate H+ ions to solutions
	-Bases accept H+ ions from solutions
	*Buffers
		-resist changes in pH
		-Accept H+ ions when they are in excess.
		-Donate H+ ions when they are depleted
		-eccential for homeostasis.
		-present in blood serum, ectoplasm
IX. Energy
	- ability to do work or supply heat
