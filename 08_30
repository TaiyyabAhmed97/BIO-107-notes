I.Inside The Cell
	-Cell Structure
	-Cell Types
		A.Prokaryotic
		B.Prokryotic
	-Cell Sizes
	-Nuclues
	-Cytoplasm
		-Ribosomes
		-Endomemebranes
		-Cell junctions
		-Cytoskeleton
	-Organelle function
	-Summary
II.Cell Theory
	-All organisms are made of cells
	-All cells arise from prexisting cells
	What Does This mean?
	-Cells alike in chemical composition
	-Cells are the unit of function in an organism
III.Architectural Plans
	* 3 types of organisms by phylogeny: Bacteria, Archae, Eukaryotes
	* 2 Basic cell types
		-Prokaryotic
			-Bacteria
			-Archae
		-Eukaryotic
			-protists
			-multicellular
IV.Prokaryotic Cells
	-Small
	-Usually unicellular
	-No internal membranes
	-no internal compartments
	-Earliest, most abundant life forms
	-Includes many pathogen
	* a prokayotic cell is enclosed by a plasma membrane and is usually encased 		in a cell wall
		-the cell wall may be covered by a stick cell wall
		-inside the cell are its DNA and oter parts
V.Eukaryotic Cells
	-Protists, Fungi, Plants and Animals are composed of these cells
	-larger and more complex than prokaryotes
	-distinguished by internal membranes
	*Cells are divided into compartments
		-seperate incompatible chemical reactions
		-increases efficiency of chemical reactions
	*A plant cell has some structures that animal cell do not:
		-Cholorplasts (photosynthesis)
		-Rigid cell wall
		-Central vauole
VI.Cell size varie with function
	-1 meter = 10^2 cm = 10^3 mm = 10^6 um = 10^9 nm
VII.Limits ON Cell Size
	-Minimum: large enough to house parts needed to survive and reprodouce
	-Maximum: limted by surface area to volume ratio
	-Large Cell: small surface relative to large volume
	-Surface/volume imposes upper limits on cell size
VIII. Main Cellular Compartments
	*Nucleus
		-site of DNA, RNA synthesis
	*Cytoplasm
		-site of protein synthesis, metabolism
		-contains membranous organelles
IX.The Nuclues
	*Bounded by nuclear envelope
		-douvle layered mmebrane
		-has many pores
		-connected to endoplasmic reticulum
	*Contains nucleolus
		-site of ribosome synthesis, assembly
	*Contains Chromatin
		-DNA/Protein complexes that condense to form chromosomes during 		cell division
X.Cytoplasm
	-Endomembrane system:
		-Endoplasmic Reticulum(rough and smooth)	
		-Golgi Apparatus
		-Ribosomes
		-Lysosomes
		-Cytoskeleton fibers
		-Energy transfer organelles
XI.Endomembrane system
	*interconnected membrane components
		-ER, golgi apparus, lysosomes, vauoles
	*synthesis, transport of materials
	*fucntions with plasma membrane
	*divide the cell into functional compartments
XII. Rough ER makes membrane and proteins
	-manufactures membranes
	-ribosomes on its surface produce proteins
	-protein is folded in ER
XIII.Smooth ER
	-functions:
		-synthesize lipids
		-in some cells, it regulates carbohydrate metabolism and breaks 		down toxins and drugs
XIV.The golgi apparatus
	-finishes, sorts, and ships cell products
	-consists of stacks of membranous sacs
	-recieve and modify ER products, then send to toher organelles or to plasma 		membrane
XV. Lysosomes digest food and water
	-lysosomes are sacs of digestive enzymes budded off the Golgi
	-digest by:
		-Phagocytosis
		-Autophagy
XVI.Energy transfer organelles
	-Cholorplasts
		-harvest solar energy
		-synthesize food
	-Mitochondria
		-energy conversion - food into energy
XVII.Cell dynamics and the endomembrane system
	-Proteins(cell products) are made on ribosomes and shipped to their 		destination
	-Some proteins are inserted into the ER during synthesis, folded, modified 		there
	-These proteins are shipped to the Golgi
	-They are modified, packaged and shipped to their dest
XVIII. How are products shipped form golgi
	-proteina re sorted into distinct vesicles in the golgi appratus and 		additional moleuclar tags determining their destination:
		-plasma mamebrane
		-ER
		-Lysosomes
XIX. Cell Dynamics: The Cytoskeleton
	-Micofilaments of actin enable cells to change shape and move
	-Intermediate filaments reinforce the cell and anchor certain organelles
	-Microtubles
		-give cell rigidity
		-provide anchors for organelles
		-at as tracks for organelle movement
