I.Carbon based Life
	-carbon reacts with more atoms and forms more compounds than all other 		elements put together
II.Chemistry of Carbon
	-inner shell is full
	-outer shell has 4 electrons
	-outer shell can hold eight
	-forms covalent bonds, 4 single or 2 double to hold 8 electrons
*Cells Make many different molecules from a small number of monomers
	-most of the large molecules in living things are macromolecules called 	polymers
	-Polymer: long chains of smalled molecular units called monomers
*Monomers are linked to form polymers by Dehydration Synthesis
	-Condensation reaction; Monomer in , Water out
*Polymers are converted to Monomers by Hydrolysis
	-Hydrolysis reaction: water in, monomer out
*Peptide bonds form when the Carboxyl Group of one Amino Acid reacts with the Amino group of a second Amino Acid

?. Proteins
	-Monomers: amino acids
		-contain 3 chemical groups
	-20 differnet amino acids
	-structureally, functionally deiverse
?.Amino Acid
	- Amino group, Side chain, caboxyl group
	-Side chain = R groups: 	
		-determine properties of amino acid
		-some participate in chemical reactions
		
?.Primary Protein Structure
	-Amino acid sequence is primary structure of proteins
		-Stabilized by peptide bonds
?. Secondary structure
	-a-helix
	-b-pleated sheet
		-Stabilized by Hydrogen bonds form between groups along 		peptide-bonded backbone
?. Tierchiary
	-overall 3 dimensional shape of a polypeptide
	-5 types of interactions involving R-groups are important:
		-Hydrogen Bonding between polar side chains and opposite partial 			charges in the backbone or other R-groups
		-Hydrophobic interactions of non polar side chains to form globular 			masses
		-van der Waals interactions that increase stability of structure
		-Covalent Bonding aka disulfide bonds that are bridges between 			distint regions of the same polypeptide or 2 seperate polypeptides
		-Ionic Bonding
	-Hydrophobic interactions
	-Disulfide bond
	Ionic bond
?. Quarternary Structure
	-shape produced by combination of polypeptides.
?.Protein Structure summary
	-Enzymes (Catalysis) - help body regulate
	-Defense (Immune system)
	-Movement (mUscles)
	-Signaling (Hormones, signal proteins)
	-Structure (Hair, cell membranes)
?.Nucleic Acids
	-DNA and RNA encode genetic information in their sequence
	-DNA and RNA serve as the blueprints for proteins
	-They ultimatelt control the life of a cell
	*Directional polymer of nucleotides
		-Phospahtes, sugars, and bases
	-polar from 5' to 3'
	-write from 5' to 3'
?. Watson-Crick model of DNA
	-2 DNA strands form complementary base pairs
		-A-T, G-C form through hydrogenbonding
		-G-C has 3 hydrogen bonds
		-A-T has 2
?. DNA structure
	-2 antiparallel strands from a double helix	
	-hydrophilic sugar-phospahte backbone faces exterior
	-purine-pyrimidine base pairs on the interior
	-2 polynucleotide chains to form a right handed double helix
?. RNA structure
	-RNA contains uracil instead of thymine
	-RNA contains ribose instead of deoxy
?. Carbohydrates
	-Monosaccharides
		-monomers that form polysacchrides
	-contain hydroxyl, carbonyl groups
	-classified according to number of carbon atoms
	-end in -ose
	-may have linear or ring structure
?. Polysaccharides
	-Long chains of sugar monomers
	-linked by dehydration syntheis
	-can be branched - gives diversity
	*energy storage
		-glycogen and starch
	*Strcuture
		-Cellulose
	*animal store sugars as Glycogen
		-glucose polymer with ranches about every 10 monomers
		-combine and link and branch or unbranch makes starch
	*Cellulose, primary component of the plant cell wall
?. Carbohydrate functions
	-Cellulose in plants, chtin in insects, chondoitin sulfate in bones, 		ligaments
	-Cell identity
		-Glycoproteins give a cell an identity recognized by immune system
	-Energy storage
		-store sunlight as chemical energy
		-release glucose for energy production
?. Lipids and fats
	-fatty acids, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids
	-carbon containing molecules
	-mostly non polar
	-mostly hydrophobic
	-do not dissolve in water(have a hydrocarbon structure)
	3 main types
		-fats
		-phospholipids
		-steroids
