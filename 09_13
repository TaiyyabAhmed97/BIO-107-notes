?.Mechanisms of Cellular Reproduction
	-Binary Fission
		-Prokrayotes (Bacteria)
		-Some Eukaryotic Protists (hydra)
	-Mitosis (part of cell cycle)
	-Meiosis (gamete formation)
?.Prokaryotes reproduce by binary fission
	-prokaryotic cells posses a single chromosome, containing genes
	-chromsome is replicated
	-cell the divides into 2 cells, binary fission
?.The Cell cycle
	-Interphase: where chromosomes duplicate and cell parts are made
	-Mitotic phase: when cell division occurs
?.Interphase
	-time between divisions
	-has 3 parts
		-G1: growth, synthesis of cytoplasm, membranes
		-S: DNA synthesis, chromosome replication
		-G2: growth, preparation for division
?.Timing of cell cycle
	-variable
	-G1: 9-10 hours
	-S: 10 hours
	-G2: 2-3 hours
	-M: 1 hour
?.Overvie of mitosis
	-chromosomes replicated before mitosis (in S stge of interphase)
	-copies of each chromosome given to each daughter cell
	-complete set of chromosomes in each daughter cell
	-daughter cells are genetically identical
?.Mitosis
	-Prophase
	-Metaphase
	-Anaphase
	-Telophase
?.Each Chromosome contains a single DNA molecule
	-individual chromosomes are visible only during cell division
	-during interphase, chromosomes are uncoiled and dispersed, visible as 		chromatin granules in the nucleus
	-chromosomes replicate int he S stage of interphase
*when cell divides, sister chromatids seperate
*2 daughter cells are produced
	-each has a complete and identical set of chromosomes
?.Events in Prophase
	-chromosomes condense and become visble in the light microscope
	-mitotic spindle forms from a microtubule-ogranizing center
	-nucleolus disappears and nuclear envelope disintegrates
	
?.Metaphase
	-centrisomes completed migrations to opposite sides of cell
	-spindle fibers attached kintechores
	-chromosomes spread out like a aplte on equator
?.Anapahse
	-centromeres split
	-sister chromatids seperate and are pulled toward opposite polesof cell
	-sepreteaed chroamtids are now chromosomes
?.Telophase
	-nuclear envelope begins tor eform 
	-spindle apparatus is disassempbled
	-chromosomes begin to unwind and decondense
?.Cytokinesis
	-division to form cytoplasm t form 2 daughter cells,
	-ring of actin and myosin filaments on inside of the plasm membrane, 		causing it to pinch in a cleavege furrow
?.Cytokinesis in animal cells
	-occurs by cleavage of the cytoplasm
	-process pinches cells apart
?.Cytokinesis in plant cells
	-start forming vesicles instead of kinetechores
	-vesicles grow and expand into a cell wall tht seperetes the cells
?.Summary of mitosis and cytokinesis
	-Prophase
		-replicated chromosomes become visible
	-Metaphase
		-chromosomes align at equator
		-attached to spindle fibers
	-Anaphase
		-centromeres split, chromosomes migrate
	-Telophase
		-chromosomes uncoil, reform chromatin
		-nuclear envelope reforms
	-Cytokinesis
		-cytoplasm divides
?.Significance of mitosis
	-reproduction(single celled organisms
	-growth
	-cell replacement, repair
?.evidence of control of the cell cycle
	-haflick limit
		-cells from different organisms have the ability to divided 			diffretn number of times 
	-action of growth factors
	-several genetic disorders
	-genes involved in cancer
?.Control Points
	-G1/S control point
		-commitment point cells pass into S will divide
	-G2 control point
		-check DNA, make any repairs
	-M control point
		-ensure spindles are attached
?.Cancer is a disease of the cell cylce
	-clonal in origin - begins from single cell with 2 or more mutations
	-unconrolled growth - cell escapes cell cycle control forms malinant growth
	-moves to other sites - metastasis starts new tumors at new locations
?.Mutant genes and cancer
	-2 classes of genes involved:
	-tumor suppressed genes:
		-stop cell divisions when the genes are expressed
	-oncogenes:
		-start cell divisions or maintain vell division when expressed
