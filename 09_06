					Cellular Respiration

I.Background
	-Breathing supplies O2 to cells and removes CO2
	- Sugar + O2 -> ATP + CO2 +H2O
II.Converting food to energy
	-all cellular fucntions requrie energy
	-ATP is common source of energy
	-ATP is produced by breaking chemical bonds in food molecules, tranferring 		energy into bonds in ATP 
	-ATP production requries oxygen
	-ATP produces CO2 and H2O as by products
III. Cellular Respiration stores energy in ATP
	-CR breaks down glucose and banks energy in ATP
IV.ATP
	-contains 3 phospahte groups, ribose, and adenine
	-ATP + water = ADP + Pi (inorganic phosphate group) + Energy
V.ATP cycle
	1.Energ from exergonic reactions
	2.Dehydration synthesis
	3.Hydrolysis
	4.Energy for endergonic reactions
VI. Mechanism of energy release
	-Oxidation: loss of electrons
	-Reduction: gain of elctrons
VII.Cellular Respiration
	-respiration is a 3 step process
		-first step in cytoplasm
		-2 steps in mitochondria
VIII.Stages of CR
	1.Glycolysis - breakdown of sugar molecules into pyruvate starts energy 	harvest
	2.Krebs Cycle - breaks down pyruvate, does more energy harvesting
	3.Electron transport - completes energy harvesting
	-Net result = ATP synthesis
IX.Glycolysis
	-converts glucose (6 carbons) into pyruvic acid (each with 3 carbons)
	-ten steps in the process (all in cytoplasm)
	-2 things happen:
		-glucose activated by ATP, addition of P
		-Energy harvested in the form of ATP and electrons transferred to 			NADH
X.Products of glycolysis
	*Pyruvate
		-2 molecules of pyruvate
	*ATP
		-2 ATP molecues per glucose
	*NADH
		-2 NADH molecules per glucose
XI. Transtition from Glycolysis to Krebs Cycle
	-each pyruvic acid is broken down to form CO2 and a 2 carbon acetyl group, 		which enters the Krebs cycle
	-coenzyme a combines with broken pyruvate acid to form Acetly CoA
XII.Krebs Cycle overview
	-in transition reaction in  krebs cycle, chemical bonds in pyruvate are 	broken down to produce CO2 and H2O
	-energy released in breaking these bonds is saved in ATP. some ATP is made 		in Krebs cycle, most is made in stage 3
XIII. Products of the Krebs Cycle
	*ATP
		-2 per glucose molecule
	*NADH
XIV. Electron tranport and chemiosis
	-electrons from NADH and FADH2 travel down the electron transport chain to 		 oxygen
	-energy released by the electrons  is used to pump H+ into outer compartment
	-in chemiosis, the H+ ions flow back into inner compartment through ATP 	synthase complexes, which capture enrgy to make ATP
XVI.Pumping produces a proton concentration grdient
	-during transpoer, enrgy lost by electrons is sued to pump protons in the 		intermembrane space	
	-difference in proton concentration across the memebrane creates potential 		energy
	-ATP synthase allows pton to reenter and energy is realsed to synthesize 		ATP from ADP and inorganic phospate
XVII.When Electron Transport goes wrong
	-free radical pruced when electrons jump directly to molecular oxygen and 		bypass hydrogen
	-ROS damages mitochondria
XVIII.Fermentation is an Anerobic alternative for maing ATP
	-under anaerboc conditions, many cells can use glycolysis to produce small 		amounts of ATP without oxygen as an electron receptor
	-cell must be able to use another elctron acceptor to regenerate NAD+ from  		NADH
IXX.Humans regenrate NAD+ by maing Lactic Acid
XX. fermentaion is inefficient
	-extrememyl inefficeint comapred with CR
